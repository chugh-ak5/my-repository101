# Correlation and Covariance Analysis
Correlation Analysis on the FAANG and other stocks in relation to their peers with heatmaps with seaborn.

# Simple Return Analysis on Portfolio Securities  
The main intention of this repo is to understand the risk and return analysis amongst other forms of analysis.
Simple return analysis on the FAANG and other stocks would provide a notion onto how investors would better manage their risks with an equally weighted porfolio and an unequally weighted portfolio. 
As the beta of each stock is different, the returns on equal weights and unequal weights would thereby be different.
Simple returns can be used on individual securities as well as a portfolio of securities. 

# Logarithmic Returns on Individual Securities
Logarithmic returns or log returns are used on individual securities, that way the returns on the securities are normally distributed.
The log returns of an individual security for a year would be the sum of the daily log returns of that particular security for that year. 
In order to eliminate the positive bias on individual securities we use log returns rather than simple arithmetic returns so investors would have an average return > 0.

# Regression Analysis 
Regression Analysis on the estimation of relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables over a time period.
